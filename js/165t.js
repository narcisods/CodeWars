//Details
// Due to another of his misbehaved, the primary school's teacher of the young Gauß, Herr J.G. Büttner, to keep the bored and unruly young schoolboy Karl Friedrich Gauss busy for a good long time, while he teaching arithmetic to his mates, assigned him the problem of adding up all the whole numbers from 1 through a given number n.

// Your task is to help the young Carl Friedrich to solve this problem as quickly as you can; so, he can astonish his teacher and rescue his recreation interval.

// Here's, an example:

// f(n=100) // returns 5050
// It's your duty to verify that n is a valid positive integer number. If not, please, return false (None for Python, null for C#, 0 for COBOL).

// Note: the goal of this kata is to invite you to think about some 'basic' mathematic formula and how you can do performance optimization on your code.

// Advanced - experienced users should try to solve it in one line, without loops, or optimizing the code as much as they can.

//PREP
//PARAMETER: What can you take in?
//

//RETURNS: How? print to console? Return?
//

//EXAMPLES: Examples of how the code should work?
//

//PSEDUO CODE: Write pseduo code for everything
//

// My Solution
function f(n) {
	if (n <= 0 || typeof n != 'number' || n % 1 !== 0) return false;

	return (n / 2) * (n + 1);
}
// Test Cases

// Codewars Solution
function f(n) {
	return parseInt(n) === n && n > 0 ? (n * (n + 1)) / 2 : false;
}
